        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There is nothing more fun or delicious to eat than freshly steamed 
            lobster dipped in butter and lemon. I like to eat lobster outdoors 
            on the deck with backed potatoes and corn on the cob. What a glorious
            feast!
            
        <ul>SERVES 4</ul>
        <ul>3 TABLESPOONS OF KOSHER SALT</ul>
        <ul>4 LIVE LOBSTERS (1 1/4 TO 1 1/2 POUNDS EACH</ul>
        <ul>LEMON WEDGES FOR SERVING</ul>
        <ul>LEMON-CAPER BUTTER</ul>
        <ul>1/2 CUP (1 STICK) UNSALTED BUTTERMILK</ul>
        <ul>1 TEASPOON FRESH LEMON JUICE</ul>
        <ul>1 TEASPOON CAPERS, DRAINED</ul>
        <ul>1 TEASPOON CHOPPED FRESH CHIVES</ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Fill a large soup pot or lobster pot two-thirds full of water. Add the salt and
                bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>When the water has come to a rolling boil, plunge the lobsters head first into 
                the pot. Cover the lobsters until the shells turn bright red, 10-12 minutes 
                (see Note).</li>
            <li>Lift the lobsters out of the water with tongs and drain well in a colander.
                Remove the rubber bands from the claws, crack the claw shells, and drain off the 
                excess liquid.</li>
            <li>To make the Lemon-Caper Butter, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Stir in the 
                lemon juice, capers, and chives and keep warm, over very low heat, stirring 
                occasionally, until ready to serve.</li>
        
        <p>Note: A rule of thumb for boiling lobster is</p>
        <ul>1 1/4 to 1 1/2 - pound lobsters, cook 10-12 minutes</ul>
        <ul>1 3/4 to 2 - pound lobsters, cook 15-18 minutes</ul>
